## TODO: This page should have a brief overview of how to use the editor with images
##		  and everything else. It should be the default page shown when the editor is opened,
##		  a blank screen if the user has removed it.

## Also a good idea to have a simple process diagram for how the client engine starts, server engine starts, how they
## communicate, etc...
